# Unfollower-Github-Bot

# Info
<p>
It unfollows users you're following, it runs in the background so you can still do what you do without it bothering you. <br>
It's not really fast it takes 3 seconds per unfollow if you're following a lot of people it will take awhile. <br>
It's only used on Chrome so make sure you change the (PATH = "C:\Program Files (x86)\chromedriver.exe") where your chromedriver.exe is. <br>
